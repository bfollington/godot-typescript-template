# godot-typescript-template

ECMAScript Godot test, grab the editor build from https://github.com/GodotExplorer/ECMAScript to open the project.

# Setup

- Download editor build from https://github.com/GodotExplorer/ECMAScript
- Clone this repo
- Install node.js
- Run `npm i` in the room
- Run `npm run watch` to launch `tsc`

Use `godot` as normal, you can launch debugging sessions from VS Code (config will need to be updated with the correct path to `godot` on disk). Breakpoints only work in the generated `.jsx` files, not `.ts` or `.tsx` files.
